# Password_Generator
A basic password generator used to create passwords meeting strict security requirements on various websites.

The idea is for it to generate a password to meet the following common requirements:
1) at least one lowercase letter  (a - z)
2) at least one uppercase letter  (A - Z)
3) at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()-=+)
4) must NOT consist of basic dictionary words

Note: It currently only creates a password of length 15 of random characters from the ASCII table. It does not guarantee each of the security requrements listed above.

# TODO
1) Ensure the generator meets ALL requirements for each generated password
2) Options to limit the generator to only lowercase letters, special characters, or a mix between everything.
3) Create a GUI (TKinter or Kivvy ???)
